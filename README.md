TBGraph is an end-to-end, explainable knowledge graph framework that transforms population-scale TB insurance claims into governance-ready equity insights. It exposes disparities in tuberculosis care access between subsidized (PBI) and non-PBI patients across hospital tiers and 500+ Indonesian cities/regencies, with full GNN explainability.

## Overview

Indonesia carries one of the world's highest tuberculosis burdens, yet systemic inequities in care quality and access remain poorly quantified at national scale. TBGraph leverages anonymized BPJS Kesehatan claims data — Indonesia's national health insurance program covering over 260 million enrollees — to construct a semantically rich knowledge graph linking patients, facilities, regions, and clinical outcomes. A Graph Attention Network (GAT) then performs equity reasoning across this graph, and GNNExplainer surfaces the subgraph features that drive disparity predictions. The result is a transparent, reproducible pipeline designed to support evidence-based TB governance and policy.

## Key Features

- **Population-scale KG construction** — Builds a heterogeneous knowledge graph from millions of TB insurance claims spanning 500+ Indonesian cities and regencies using NetworkX and RDFLib.
- **Domain ontology** — A custom OWL/SKOS ontology (`tbgraph_ontology.ttl`) encodes TB care concepts, insurance categories (PBI/non-PBI), hospital tiers (FKTP/FKRTL), and regional administrative hierarchies.
- **Equity-focused GAT reasoning** — A Graph Attention Network learns node embeddings that capture structural disparities between subsidized poor patients (PBI) and general enrollees across facility tiers and geographies.
- **GNNExplainer attribution** — Subgraph-level explanations identify which patient–facility–region relationships most strongly predict care inequity, making model decisions interpretable for policymakers.
- **Governance-ready outputs** — Structured JSON policy reports and region-level CSV statistics are generated automatically, formatted for direct use in public health reporting workflows.
- **Synthetic data generation** — Because the real BPJS dataset is restricted, the pipeline notebook includes a reproducible synthetic data generator that mirrors the statistical properties of the original claims data.

## Requirements

Python 3.9 or higher is required. Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torch-geometric \
            networkx rdflib \
            pandas scikit-learn \
            matplotlib seaborn
```

> **Note:** For `torch-geometric`, match the version to your CUDA/CPU build. See the [PyTorch Geometric installation guide](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html) for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tbgraph.git
cd tbgraph

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision torch-geometric \
            networkx rdflib \
            pandas scikit-learn \
            matplotlib seaborn

# 3. Launch the pipeline notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/TBGraph_Pipeline.ipynb
```

Run the cells sequentially. The notebook is organized into four clearly labeled stages matching the pipeline above.

## Dataset

The real BPJS Kesehatan TB claims data used in this research is **restricted** and cannot be redistributed. Access is subject to formal data-sharing agreements with BPJS Kesehatan and the Indonesian Ministry of Health.

**A synthetic data generator is included in the notebook.** Navigate to **Stage 1A** (`TBGraph_Pipeline.ipynb`) to generate a synthetic cohort that mirrors the statistical structure of the original dataset — including patient insurance category (PBI/non-PBI), hospital tier distributions, regional codes, treatment outcomes, and visit frequency. All downstream pipeline stages run identically on synthetic data.
